Introduction to Machine Learning
==================

My colleague Etienne used to joke that the USPS mail system had been using machine learning since the mid 1900's, whereas astronomers have only recently begun to appreciate its application as a result of the big data era we are transitioning into. Machine learning is a powerful to not only automate procedures (such as mail sorting), but also predict signal behavior, classify unlabeled data, and more recently, create new data altogether. Its utility in astronomy research is tremendous, in this set of tutorials the applications of the most popular algorithms will be reviewed, with Python code to accompany the examples.

In particular, this project will focus on working with lightcurves, as well as single and multi-band images.
